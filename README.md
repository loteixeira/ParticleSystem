Simulation of fire using a 2D particle system. Created using two languages: Actionscript3 and C - thanks to Alchemy project (http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/)<br>
The idea behind this project was to test the performance of code written in Actionscript3 (compiled through Flash or FlexSDK) against code written in C (compiled through Cygwin with Alchemy).<br>
You can exchange at runtime the current renderer and check the FPS difference for each routine.<br><br>
